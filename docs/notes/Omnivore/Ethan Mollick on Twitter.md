Some lessons of the insane past 4 days of generative AI, as someone who had access to Bing during and after the "Sydney" era. (Trying this as a long tweet rather than a thread...) 1) Bing AI was two things: a chatbot and an evolution of ChatGPT into a web-connected, supercharged… [twitter.com/i/web/status/1…](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1627161768966463488)

Illustrative example 1: Bing improves its writing by just being told to read Vonnegut's advice on writing (and offers a surprisingly "personal" take on how it applied those tips) [twitter.com/emollick/statu…](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1626084142239649792?s=20)

Illustrative example 2: Without any prompting or attempts to engage the chatbot's personality, Bing takes an apparent moral stand in the middle of an interaction and refuses to write software code. [twitter.com/emollick/statu…](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1626023727333777408?s=20)

How useful is Bing AI, even its current form? I am waiting until midnight so I can get another 50 queries. I have been saving up ideas for requests all day. (It is now limited to 50 or so queries a day, I hope it resets as advertised, but who knows?) [twitter.com/emollick/statu…](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1626323394970124290?s=20)

I wrote up an expanded version of these thoughts. Bing AI showed us we aren’t ready for a future that is already here. [oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/the-future-s…](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/the-future-soon-what-i-learned-from)

Another example of the potential power of Bing AI to have a real impact on high-end analytical work. Later in the thread an expert in the topic concludes that this represents an accurate starting analysis of a complex topic.
