*Noted Internet thinker and author [[Clay Shirky]] delivered one of the opening "provocations" at Supernova 2007. Using a 1300-year-old Japanese shrine as a metaphor, Clay explained how the New Network changes the basic dynamics of business and collective creativity.*

```transcript:  
This is the Ise shrine
it's a Shinto shrine in Ise, Japan and the shrine has
been there for 1300 years and seeing
that the Japanese government thought
thought to have this listed in the
UNESCO Registry of Historic Places and
when they did that UNESCO said roughly
"Get out of our face with that 'thirteen
hundred year' stuff there's no way that
building is that old we're not listing it"

So why the disagreement? The shrine as
you can see is built out of wood, never a
material prized for millennial scale
structural integrity but the (???)
priests who run the shrine know that so
periodically they have a ceremony where
they tear the shrine to the ground and
then they go to the forest where the
wood from the original shrine built in
690 came from and they build another
shrine out of the same kind of material
on the same spot to the same architectural plan 
and from their point of view,
since the function of the shrine
is to delineate sacred space from
ordinary space the shrine has been there
for 1300 years. It's just built out of
renewable materials 

UNESCO's response was that's not what we mean when we say
historic. Right? what we care about is solidity of edifice
not solidity of process.

Hold that thought. In 1995 I was in
charge of technology for a little web
shop in Manhattan or a dozen of us
working out of Seth(???) Goldstein's living
room; it was very picturesque and like
the dog that caught the... proverbial dog
that caught the bus we landed AT&T as a
client.

We had some calendaring technology they wanted to use and 
they hired us to build some web sites and 
once the ink on the contract was dry the engineers came
around and so of course we had to have a
fight about programming languages. It's
like hello between techies so this was
big culture clash. Most of those guys had
been at AT&T longer than most of us had
been out of college. They were C++
engineers, C++ having been invented at
AT&T.
We were Perl hackers, so already
they were horrified and we fought back
and forth about the relative merits of
each language and the place they really
thought they had us was on support. 
"Where can you possibly get commercial support 
for Perl?" and we said "we don't have any" 
"You don't have any support?!"
we said "We... we didn't say that, we said we don't 
have commercial support. We get our support from the
Perl community"
and from the looks on their faces you could tell 
as if it was, as if we had told them "We get our
Thursday's from a banana" 
like it just didn't make any sense 
what we just said. They'd never heard the words community
and support in the same sentence 

So it's another "look look there's this, there's
this news group comp Lang Perl misc", all
right and we go to that news group and
we post our questions and other people
answer them and other people post their
questions and we answer them. We all kind
of get it done together. This did not
make any sense. More arguing. "Look"
we said, "we'll show you". So we come up
with a moderately complicated question
we post it to Usenet, we had an answer
before the meeting was over and who it
was at that moment that I understood
what was going on. Because they didn't
care. They didn't care that they'd seen
it work in practice because they already
knew it couldn't work in theory. Right.
Support is critical. You don't get
support from something as evanescent as
an unspoken bargain in a community;
support comes from something concrete
like a contract with a company. right. so
we had that argument a dozen years ago
what's going on now well the slide I
just pulled up and I'll pull up again is
actually from yesterday this is from
comp lang perl misc from yesterday.
People are still asking questions people
are still answering questions with the
explosion of social media that we've
seen there's obviously lots and lots of
places to talk about perl now but the
original site of the conversation and
the the source of the argument comp Lang
perl misc is doing fine. And AT&T. How's AT&T
doing? Not as fine, right, so in fact
right, th-the solidity was on the side
of the thing that looked evanescent.

Perl is a Shinto shrine. Perl exists not as
an edifice but as an act of love. 
Perl is a viable programming option again
today because millions of people woke up
this morning loving perl, and more
importantly, they love one another in the
context of perl. They love one another
enough to stop what they're doing and
listen to each other to have a
conversation (???? to Denise's point) and to
answer questions for one another, to
diagnose things for one another,
sometimes to write codes for one another.

Oh I think I see what's going on here
Try this - no contracts are written, no
money changes hands, the work goes on.

We don't often talk about love at
gatherings like this it seems too
squishy and certainly seem too squishy
to the AT&T guys but what has
happened, what is happening in our
generation right now is that we have a set
of tools for aggregating things that
people care about in ways that increase
both the scope and the longevity in ways
that were unpredictable even a decade
ago. right. The coordinating tools we now
have, and I'm not talking about anything
fancy, I'm talking about mailing lists
and Usenet and web blogs and wikis; 
those tools turn love into a renewable
building material. 

In the middle of the 90s most software was commercially
manufactured, but there were a handful of
things whose only visible means of
support was love plus mailing lists.
Which doesn't seem like a very
auspicious place to start. Perl. Apache.
Linux. But standing there and looking
today, and more importantly standing from
today looking towards the future you
will make more accurate predictions
about about software, and in this web
driven world about services, if you ask
yourself not what's the business model
but rather "do the people who like it
take care of each other?" 
That turns out to be the better predictor of longevity
The (???) priests would totally get Linux 
Linux gets rebuilt every night by people whose principle
goal is that it continues to exist the following morning.
Now this doesn't mean that the market is going to wither
away and we're all going to live in some
sort of lovely post-capitalist commune.
There's lots of commercial opportunity.
There has always been lots of commercial
opportunity; there will always be lots of
commercial opportunity. 

It does mean that the ability to aggregate 
non-financial motivations, to get people together
outside of managerial culture and for
reasons other than the profit motive has
received a huge comparative advantage.
And it also means that many of the
future commercial opportunities are
going to be inextricably intertwined
with that kind of work and those kind of
groups. Right. When Linus Torvalds posted
his first message in 1991 hinting at
what Linux was to become - it's a very
modest message "I've got this little
hobby project project in mind" 

within 24 hours he had responses from Stuttgart,
from Vienna, from San Jose, from Sydney,
he had a global network of collaborators
not asking for anything other than the
chance to come together and do something
interesting that was new. And that
pattern that pattern of aggregating
caring into something stable and
long-lasting is going everywhere
Wikipedia. The anti anti-immigration
protests in the California schools that
were coordinated through myspace. right.
The monitoring of the Nigerian elections
by a loose collection of people using
SMS and camera phones to watch their own
elected officials.
The use of Flickr to coordinate information and disaster
relief after the Indian Ocean tsunami after the London transit bombings after the Madrid bombing. 
And the number of places that pattern will go in the future is much greater than the number of places that pattern has already gone

We have always loved one another we're
human it's something we're good at but
up until recently the radius and
half-life of that affection has been
quite limited. With love alone you can
get a birthday party together. Add
coordinating tools and you can write an.
operating system.

In the past, we would do little things
for love. But big things, big things
required money. Now we can do big things
for love. Thank you
